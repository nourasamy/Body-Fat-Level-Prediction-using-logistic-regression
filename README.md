# Body-Fat-Level-Prediction-using-logistic-regression

Bodyfat-Level.csv dataset contains estimates for the Level of a body fat determined by
underwater weighting and various body circumference measurements for 252 men.
There are 5 levels of bodyfat based on the percentage as follow:


1. Essential fat when percentage is 10-13%

2. Athletes when percentage is 14-20%

3. Fitness when percentage is 21-24%

4. Acceptable when percentage is 25-31%

5. Obesity when percentage is >32%

The dataset consist of the following columns:

 Density determined from underwater weighing

 Level of body fat from Siri's (1956) equation

 Age (years)

 Weight (lbs)

 Height (inches)

 Neck circumference (cm)

 Chest circumference (cm)

 Abdomen 2 circumference (cm)

 Hip circumference (cm)

 Thigh circumference (cm)

 Knee circumference (cm)

 Ankle circumference (cm)

 Biceps (extended) circumference (cm)

 Forearm circumference (cm)

 Wrist circumference (cm)

it’s required to do the following:

1. Randomly select 10% of the dataset records and save them into Bodyfat-Level-TestData.csv file

2. Design and Implement a ML algorithm to predict the body fat Level from density,
age, weight, height, neck circumference, chest circumference, abdomen 2
circumference, hip circumference, thigh circumference, knee circumference, ankle
circumference, biceps circumference, forearm circumference and wrist
circumference.

3. Use the extracted Test data records from Step 1 to test your implemented algorithm.
